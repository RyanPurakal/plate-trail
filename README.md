# Plate Trail

A privacy-audit tool that measures what a history of automated license plate
reader (ALPR) reads could reveal about a driver, using only public camera
locations and synthetic drivers. See
[the proposal](KTP-Capstone-Proposal-Plate-Trail.md).

Setup instructions, ethics statement, and build status are added as the
project is built.

## Quick start (development)

Requires Docker. PostGIS is published on host port **5434** (override with
`PLATETRAIL_DB_PORT`) to avoid clashing with other local Postgres instances.

```bash
docker compose up -d --build      # db :5434, api :8000, web :3000
curl localhost:8000/health
```

Backend tests locally (Python 3.12):

```bash
cd backend
python3.12 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"
docker compose up -d db
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://platetrail:platetrail@localhost:5434/platetrail .venv/bin/pytest
```

Tests marked `db` are skipped when `DATABASE_URL` is unset. CI always runs them
against a PostGIS service container.

## Camera ETL

```bash
cd backend
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://platetrail:platetrail@localhost:5434/platetrail \
  .venv/bin/python -m platetrail.etl.run_etl            # add --refresh to refetch
```

Pulls ALPR cameras (`man_made=surveillance` + `surveillance:type=ALPR`) for
Edison and New Brunswick from OpenStreetMap via Overpass. Raw responses are
cached in `data/raw/overpass/`, so reruns don't hit Overpass. Direction comes
from `camera:direction`, falling back to `direction`. When both are present and
disagree, the summary lists the camera. New sources plug in as additional
`CameraLoader`s and go through the same deduplication step.

Export the stored cameras for a quick look in [geojson.io](https://geojson.io)
or QGIS. Each camera is a point, plus a 30 m ray for each direction it faces:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m platetrail.etl.export_geojson   # -> data/exports/cameras.geojson
```

## Road network and snapping

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m platetrail.roads.run_roads      # add --refresh to re-download
```

Downloads the OSMnx `drive` graph for Edison + New Brunswick, buffered by
2 km, and caches it as GraphML under `data/graphs/`. The first download takes
several minutes. Edges are stored in `road_edges`. Each camera is snapped to
its nearest edge within 50 m. On a two-way road it gets one `camera_edges` row
per direction, with that direction's true-north bearing taken at the snap
point. The summary lists dropped cameras, snap distances, close camera pairs,
and cameras whose direction is closer to perpendicular than parallel to their
road. Rerun this after the camera ETL, because reloading cameras clears the
snaps.
